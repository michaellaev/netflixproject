# netflixproject

In the context of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Big Blue Data Academy, the project we carried out, We analyzed some insights from the Netflix dataset related to its content, its global origins, the evolution of content, as well as the Netflix platform. We also explored movies or series produced by country, their genres, and their distribution based on parental suitability.

The initial idea was the fact that we analyze data for a production company planning to finance a movie and needs insights regarding the directions it can take in terms of genre and the country where it may choose to release the film

In collaboration with: Elias Sarousavvidis and Konstantinos Nikolopoulos

One specific aspect we zoomed in on was identifying the top 5 countries with the most significant contributions to movies and TV shows content. This analysis provided valuable insights for a production company considering financing a movie, aiding in decision-making regarding genre preferences and strategic release locations.

3.What were the main findings related to the Netflix platform itself?

	First and foremost, understanding the information provided by the dataset was essential. The data includes the type (whether it is a TV show or a movie), the title of each entry, the director, the country, the date added to the platform, the release year, content suitability ratings, duration, and genres. The dataset comprises content added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021. The oldest content dates back to 1925, while the newest is from 2021.
