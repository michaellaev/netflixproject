In the context of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Big Blue Data Academy, the project we carried out, We analyzed some insights from the Netflix dataset related to its content, its global origins, the evolution of content, as well as the Netflix platform. We also explored movies or series produced by country, their genres, and their distribution based on parental suitability.

The initial idea was the fact that we analyze data for a production company planning to finance a movie and needs insights regarding the directions it can take in terms of genre and the country where it may choose to release the film

In collaboration with: Elias Sarousavvidis and Konstantinos Nikolopoulos

One specific aspect we zoomed in on was identifying the top 5 countries with the most significant contributions to movies and TV shows content.
